/// Bitcoin Multisig Wallet Module with IKA dWallet 2PC-MPC protocol
///
/// This module implements a distributed multi-signature wallet system for Bitcoin transactions
/// using the IKA dWallet 2PC-MPC protocol. It allows multiple members to collectively approve
/// or reject Bitcoin transactions before execution.
///
/// Key Features:
/// - Configurable approval and rejection thresholds
/// - Time-based request expiration
/// - Irrevocable voting (once voted, members cannot change their decision)
/// - Integration with IKA's distributed wallet protocol for enhanced security
///
/// Security Considerations:
/// - All voting decisions are final and cannot be changed
/// - Requests automatically expire after a configured duration
/// - Threshold validation prevents single points of failure
